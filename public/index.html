      Abdulla Al Mahfuz Swaron, A Web Developer. Have professional skills in React.js, HTML, CSS, Javascript, ES6, MongoDB, Firebase, and on and on. I have completed many projects using these technologies.

I convert my thoughts into code and try to do something creative always.

From childhood, I have had a curiosity about Web Technology. I wanted to understand how does it work? What is going on behind the screen? When I got an idea about programming and web development, It became my passion.

I will bring my company to the next level with honesty and sincerity and my technical skills.

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
